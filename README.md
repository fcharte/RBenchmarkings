R Benchmarkings

This document compares the performance in doing a task by means of different approaches in R. For doing so, the `microbenchmark` package is used, measuring the time spent by each approach. The results are shown numerically and plotting them using `ggplot2`.

The goal is to elucidate which is the best method to accomplish a certain task.
